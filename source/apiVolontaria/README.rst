django-api-volontaria

API to manage volunteer and order in an organisation.

Quick start
-----------

You must create a empty project and install the package.

Then you can overload the needed sections.

I suggest writing in the settings.py of the overload project :

from apiVolontaria.settings import *

It's also possible to do the same thing with the urls.
